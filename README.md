#This model is built on Python 3.5.6 and requires following packages:
tensorflow
tflearn
numpy
matplotlib
pillow
tqdm

#CNN
#To train the model from the beginning, type:
python cnn.py
#This is not recommend, it will probably take 17 hours to finish 200 epoch.

#To test on the trained model, type:
python demo.py
#This command will randonmly choose 12 images for each time from the challenge dataset from Kaggle which are unlabeled. 
#Since they are not used during the whole training, it will be a good evaluation on our model. 
#The demo will show the predictions and 12 images. 

#Softmax
#To train the model by only Softmax classifier, type:
python softmax.py

#data_helpers
#This contains all the funcions we used to resize the images and to preprocess the data.

#demo.ipynb
#This is a demo which can be opened in Jupyter notebook.

#/all (folder)
#The original dataset download from Kaggle.
#https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data
#It includes processed images(32*32).

#/data (folder)
#The processed data stored in binary files by numpy.

#All the other files are generated by the model including the parameters and the checkpoint.
